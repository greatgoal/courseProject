### Note
The original fragmented dataset can be downloaded at "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip".
After unzipping the file, there is a file called "features_info.txt" that describes the original variable names.
The original variable names have been replaced with more descriptive variable names.
In particular, "Gyro" has been replaced with "Angular Velocity". An "Average" has been added to each variable name after computing the average values of each variable.
For detailed transformation or work done to clean the data, please refer to the "Script Process & Data Transformation" section of "README.md" that can be viewed at "https://github.com/greatgoal/courseProject/blob/master/README.md".
